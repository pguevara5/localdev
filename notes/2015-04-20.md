### Configuring Virtual Hosts

After several failed attempts, I followed the tutorial on how Laravel sets up virtual hosts.
Laravel Homestead takes advantage of Virtual Box and Vagrant. 

[http://laravel.com/docs/4.2/homestead](http://laravel.com/docs/4.2/homestead)

I installed Virtual Box and Vagrant and routed abroadmarketplace.app to my Laravel installation in 
```
/Users/patrick/PhpstormProjects/abroadmarketplace
```

Removed the `/etc/apache2/vhosts/*` directory because I'm no longer running VH through Apache.
I also re-commented the `mod_rewrite` line in /etc/apache2/httpd.conf

I created a new SSH key for homestead
```
ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "you@homestead"
```
My Homestead.yaml (/Users/patrick/.homestead/Homestead.yaml) has the following:
```
ip: "192.168.10.10"
memory: 2048
cpus: 1
provider: virtualbox
authorize: ~/.ssh/homestead.pub
keys:
    - ~/.ssh/homestead
folders:
    - map: ~/PhpstormProjects
      to: /home/vagrant/Code
sites:
    - map: abroadmarketplace.app
      to: /home/vagrant/Code/abroadmarketplace/htdocs
databases:
    - homestead
variables:
    - key: APP_ENV
      value: local
# blackfire:
#     - id: foo
#       token: bar
#       client-id: foo
#       client-token: bar
```
I then modified the /etc/hosts file to the following
```
127.0.0.1       localhost
255.255.255.255 broadcasthost
::1             localhost
192.168.10.10   abroadmarketplace.app
```

### Fresh start
Going to recreate the abroadmarketplace repository with Laravel. Now I have a better understanding of what to do.

Done. Also created the metricloop repository. Got rid of Github on my local machine- going to rely on PhpStorm for 
version control. 

/etc/hosts
```
##
# Host Database
#
# localhost is used to configure the loopback interface
# when the system is booting.  Do not change this entry.
##
127.0.0.1       localhost
255.255.255.255 broadcasthost
::1             localhost
192.168.10.10   abroadmarketplace.com
192.168.10.10   metricloop.com
```
And the newest Homestead.yaml (/Users/patrick/.homestead/Homestead.yaml)
```
---
ip: "192.168.10.10"
memory: 2048
cpus: 1
provider: virtualbox
authorize: ~/.ssh/homestead.pub
keys:
    - ~/.ssh/homestead
folders:
    - map: ~/PhpstormProjects
      to: /home/vagrant/Code
sites:
    - map: abroadmarketplace.com
      to: /home/vagrant/Code/abroadmarketplace/public
    - map: metricloop.com
      to: /home/vagrant/Code/metricloop/public
databases:
    - homestead
variables:
    - key: APP_ENV
      value: local
# blackfire:
#     - id: foo
#       token: bar
#       client-id: foo
#       client-token: bar
```

Got them up and running! Now to configure the databases...
